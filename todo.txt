DONE

+ paraphrase more chap 2 and add example, see img on phone
+ rewrite section about list listset osv..
+ admitted lemmas, simplification
+ "defined WITH Set" for ex_lfp_geq
+ also add: incl s1 s2 /\ incl s2 a1
+ evaluation: refer to new points from chap 2
+ f is a model for a set of clauses if all clauses are satisfied in f; "F IS A MODEL"
+ sub_model represents different S_C, S_C|W, etc.. see img for diagram
+ lem_33 would have fixed problem with increasing set W, see img
+ complete proof overview theorem 3.2, chap 4. see paper
+ clean up sec 5.3, maybe combine 5.3.1 into just 5.3. don't go into detail about why thing fails, just say consequence of lemma 3.3.
+ add intro to chap 3, with to key concepts; leave aside sec. 2 (lattice -> Horn) and 4 (complexity) from article
+ describe two problems in chap 2
+ "problemstilling": add to chap 2, se email Marc.
+ finish section 7
+ finish section 6
+ write conlusion

TODO (in order of importance)

- determine questions to pose in abstract (remove a bit from chap 2 probably)
- read per martin-l√∂f's article, 1.4 and 1.5. use this to elaborate on chap 1 and 4, dep. type theory.
- finish "other proof assistants"
- edit last paragraph of chap 8, too grandiose
- add ensembles infinite sets, see paper (can be ignored if no time)

- all misc. red text

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THEN (before 26.05)

- double-check red text
- write finished abstract

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
