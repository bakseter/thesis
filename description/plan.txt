Goal:

The goal of this master project is to formalize
(a part of) the proofs of the following paper, [link to article]
and extract algorithms from these formalized proofs.

These algorithms shall be tested on a number of carefully chosed benchmarks,
and their performance will be compared to known algorithms that solve these benchmarks.

The difference between a program extracted from a proof and a program given by a programmer
is that the former is guaranteed to be correct, whereas for the latter, very often the correctness proofs are elighted.

We will anaylyze the results of these experiments as a case study as to whether the methodology of
extracting programs from proofs is viable.

The results will be compared to the existing litterature etc...


The paper above actually solves two problems that occur in dependant type systems where typings depend
on universe-level constraints.

We will reinterpret the results of this master project in type theory and dependant type theory, and assess
their potential to be used in proof assistants such as Coq [ref] and Agda [ref].
