\chapter{Our case}

We have used the Coq proof assistant to formalize parts of the proofs of the following paper, \citeauthor{mbezem} \cite{mbezem}.
This paper solves two problems that occur in dependent type systems where typings depend
on universe-level constraints. We focused on formalizing the proof of theorem 3.2 from the paper.
Since this proof is complex enough that mistakes are possible, it was a good candidate for formalization.
It also has direct applications to the formalization and verification of the \lstinline{Coq} proof assistant itself,
since the algorithm outlined in the proof is being tested [ref to coq/metacoq github?] for use in checking loops in Coqs type system.
