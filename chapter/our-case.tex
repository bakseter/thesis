\chapter{Our case}

We will use the Coq proof assistant to formalize parts of the proofs of the following paper, \citeauthor{mbezem} \cite{mbezem}.
This paper solves two problems that occur in dependent type systems where typings depend
on universe-level constraints. Since this proof is complex enough that mistakes are possible
it is a good candidate for formalization. We can also use this process to gain further insight
into the algorithm that lies behind the proof. It might also be interesting to use Coq to
extract programs from the final proofs.
