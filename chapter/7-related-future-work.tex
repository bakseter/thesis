\section{Related work: Universe consistency checking in Coq}

Currently no joins, only $x + k >= y$ with $k = 0,1$.
Graph-based algorithm. Ongoing effort \cite{coqgithub} to implement algorithm from \cite{mbezem}.
Plans to extend with joins for more expressivity for universe levels in Coq.
Focus on speed with current (limited) expressivity. Later more expressivity.

\section{Future work}

\subsection{Completing proof of remaining logical lemmas}

\subsection{Formal proof of Lemma 3.3}

\subsection{Proving minimality of model generated by Theorem 3.2}
