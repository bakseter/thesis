\section{Related work: Universe consistency checking in Coq}

Currently no joins, only $x + k >= y$ with $k = 0,1$.
Graph-based algorithm. Ongoing effort \cite{coqgithub} to implement algorithm from \cite{mbezem}.
Plans to extend with joins for more expressivity for universe levels in Coq.
Focus on speed with current (limited) expressivity. Later more expressivity.

\section{Future work}

\subsection{Completing proof of remaining logical lemmas}

As mentioned in \Cref{ssec:incomplete_proofs_for_some_purely_logical_lemmas}, we have not fully completed
some of the intermediate lemmas used directly in the proof of \Cref{thm:3.2}.
We have done some work on making sure these are purely logical steps,
and that they should have no effect on the final result.
Solving these would however strenghten the argument for the correctness of the proof of \Cref{thm:3.2}.

\subsection{Formal proof of \Cref{lem:3.3}}

As mentioned in \Cref{ssec:leaving_out_the_formal_proof_of_lem_33}, we have not given a full formal proof
of \Cref{lem:3.3}. As we also saw in \Cref{sec:limitations}, constructing a formal proof of this lemma
would fix some cases where the extracted algorithm fails with an expection.
Further work on a complete formalization of \Cref{thm:3.2} would certainly benefit from a formal proof of \Cref{lem:3.3}.

\subsection{Proving minimality of model generated by \Cref{thm:3.2}}

As mentioned in \Cref{ssec:proof_of_minimality}, our proof of \Cref{thm:3.2} does not include a claim that the model
generated is minimal. As later explained in the same subsection, we would only need to include one addtional
assumption in our proof of \Cref{thm:3.2} to be able to correctly claim that the model generated is minimal.
We chose not to do this, as it had no effect on the results produced by the extracted algorithm.
