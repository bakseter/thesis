\section{Correctness of informal proof}

As we have shown in our formalization and by the results of the
extraction, the informal proof of \Cref{thm:3.2} from \cite{mbezem} appears to be correct.
As mentioned in \Cref{sec:simplifications}, we have not fully formalized nor verified the entirety of the informal proofs,
and as such we cannot be 100\% sure that the informal proof of \Cref{thm:3.2} is correct.
However, we have verified the most important parts of \Cref{thm:3.2} without
encountering any problems, and we can thus be very confident that the informal proof is correct.

\section{Worthwhileness of formalization}

The formalization of the proof of \Cref{thm:3.2} from \cite{mbezem} took us about 10 months of work.
This includes the time spent on learning Coq and the time spent on the formalization of the proof.

\section{Usefulness of extracted algorithm}

As seen in \Cref{sec:real_world_example}, the extracted algorithm is useful in practice.
However, the efficiency is not very good (\textcolor{red}{is it? should check}).
There are also cases where the extracted algorithm crashses, as seen in \Cref{sec:limitations}.
However, it should not be a surprise that not every case is handled by the algorithm,
as we have not given a formal proof of \Cref{lem:3.3}.
It is actually quite surprising that the extracted algorithm works as well as it does
(when given "real world" input, that is).
