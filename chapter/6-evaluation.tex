\section{Correctness of informal proof}

As we have shown in our formalization and by the results of the
extraction, the informal proof of Theorem 3.2 from \cite{mbezem} appear sto be correct.
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:simplifications}, we have not fully formalized nor verified the entirety of the informal proofs,
and as such we cannot be 100\% sure that the informal proof of Theorem 3.2 is correct.
However, we have verified the most important parts of Theorem 3.2 without
encountering any problems, and we can then be very confident that the informal proof is correct.

\section{Worthwhileness of formalization}

The formalization of the proof of Theorem 3.2 from \cite{mbezem} took us about X months of work.
This includes the time spent on learning Coq and the time spent on the formalization of the proof.

\section{Usefulness of extracted algorithm}

As seen in \autoref{sec:real_world_example}, the extracted algorithm is useful in practice.
However, the efficiency is not very good (\textcolor{red}{is it? should check}).
