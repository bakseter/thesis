\chapter{Formalizing mathematical problems}

\section{Proofs}

When solving mathematical problems, one often uses proofs
to justify some claim. We can group proofs into two types; \textit{informal} and \textit{formal} proofs.

\subsection{Informal proofs}
An informal proof is often written in a natural language, and the proof is adequate if most
readers are convinced by the proof \cite{bpierce}.
As a proof grows larger and more complex, it becomes harder to follow, which can
ultimately lead to errors in the proof's reasoning. This might cause the whole proof
to be incorrect \cite{rkhamsi}.

\subsection{Formal proofs}
A formal proof is written in a formal language, and can be compared to a computer program
written in a programming language. Writing a formal proof is more difficult than writing an informal proof.
